# CodeTree VibeCoding Team Project Exhibition Site

## Overview

This is a React-based static exhibition website built to showcase team projects from CodeTree VibeCoding students. The site displays 6 team projects with hardcoded information, allowing visitors to view project details and participate in voting. The application has been optimized for Vercel deployment as a static site, with all team information hardcoded in the frontend.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

- ✓ Implemented complete exhibition website with 6 team projects
- ✓ Added responsive design with modern UI using shadcn/ui components
- ✓ Configured Vercel deployment settings (vercel.json, .vercelignore)
- ✓ Applied brand colors (#33bb66) and Korean typography
- ✓ Added voting section with link to external voting site
- ✓ Fixed CSS import order for production builds
- ✓ Created deployment documentation in README.md

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database Integration**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix

### Database Design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with migrations support
- **Schema**: Currently includes user management structure, ready for expansion

## Key Components

### Project Structure
```
├── client/          # React frontend application
├── server/          # Express backend server
├── shared/          # Shared TypeScript types and schemas
├── components.json  # shadcn/ui configuration
├── drizzle.config.ts # Database configuration
└── migrations/      # Database migration files
```

### Frontend Components
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library including cards, buttons, dialogs, forms
- **Pages**: Home page for project exhibition, 404 error page
- **Routing**: Single-page application with wouter routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and responsive design

### Backend Services
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with memory-based implementation
- **Route Registration**: Centralized route management system
- **Error Handling**: Global error middleware for consistent error responses
- **Development Tools**: Hot reload with Vite integration

## Data Flow

### Team Project Data
Projects are currently hardcoded in the frontend with the following structure:
- Team information (name, members, project description)
- Project images from external sources (Unsplash)
- Deployment URLs (to be manually added later)

### User Interaction Flow
1. Visitors browse the project exhibition page
2. Each project displays team info and project details
3. Links to deployed projects (when available)
4. Voting functionality (planned for future implementation)

### API Architecture
- RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- JSON request/response format
- Error handling with consistent status codes
- Request logging for development

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, React Router (wouter)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, @neondatabase/serverless
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

### Build Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Type checking and compilation
- **ESBuild**: Backend bundling for production
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with hot reload
- **Backend**: Express server with tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variables
- **Integration**: Vite proxy for API calls during development

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Static files generated by Vite build
- **Backend**: Bundle created with esbuild for Node.js
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema management
- **Deployment**: Designed for Vercel deployment with static frontend and serverless backend

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL for production
- Development/production environment detection
- Replit-specific development tools and banners

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Hardcoded Data Approach**: Team information is hardcoded in the frontend to simplify initial development, with deployment URLs to be added manually later.

2. **Full-Stack Architecture**: Despite being primarily a static site, includes backend infrastructure for future features like voting and user management.

3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage across frontend, backend, and shared schemas for better developer experience.

4. **Component Library**: Uses shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible UI components with customizable theming.

5. **Modern Tooling**: Vite for fast development, Drizzle for type-safe database operations, and TanStack Query for efficient data fetching.

The architecture supports both the immediate need for a static exhibition site and future expansion into dynamic features like voting and user interaction.
